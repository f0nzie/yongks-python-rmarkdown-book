# NLP
Natural Language Processing







## Regular Expression
- Rgular expressions (called REs or regexes) is mandatory skill for NLP. The `re` is a **built-in* library  
- It is essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module  
- Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C  

### Syntax
There are two methods to emply re. Below method compile a regex first, then apply it multiple times in subsequent code.


```python
import re
pattern = re.compile(r'put pattern here')
pattern.match('put text here')
```

Second method below employ compile and match in single line. The pattern cannot be reused, therefore good for onetime usage only.


```python
import re
pattern = (r'put pattern here')
re.match(pattern, r'put text here')  # compile and match in single line
```

### Finding

#### Find The First Match
There are two ways to find the first match:  
- **`re.search`** find first match anywhere in text, including multiline  
- **`re.match`** find first match at the BEGINNING of text, similar to `re.search`with `^`  
- Both returns first match, return  **MatchObject**  
- Both returns **None** if no match is found  


```python
pattern1 = re.compile('123') 
pattern2 = re.compile('123')
pattern3 = re.compile('^123')  # equivalent to above
text = 'abc123xyz'

## Single Line Text Example
print( 're.search found a match somewhere:\n',
       pattern1.search(text), '\n', ## found
       '\nre.match did not find anything at the beginning:\n',
       pattern2.match(text), '\n',
       '\nre.search did not find anything at beginning too:\n',
       pattern3.search(text))        ## None
```

```
#:> re.search found a match somewhere:
#:>  <re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='123'> 
#:>  
#:> re.match did not find anything at the beginning:
#:>  None 
#:>  
#:> re.search did not find anything at beginning too:
#:>  None
```

Returned **MatchObject** provides useful information about the matched string.


```python
age_pattern = re.compile(r'\d+')
age_text    = 'Ali is my teacher. He is 109 years old. his kid is 40 years old.'
first_found = age_pattern.search(age_text)

print('Found Object:           ', first_found,
      '\nInput Text:             ', first_found.string,
      '\nInput Pattern:          ', first_found.re,
      '\nFirst Found string:     ', first_found.group(),
      '\nFound Start Position:   ', first_found.start(),
      '\nFound End Position:     ', first_found.end(),
      '\nFound Span:             ', first_found.span(),)
```

```
#:> Found Object:            <re.Match object; span=(25, 28), match='109'> 
#:> Input Text:              Ali is my teacher. He is 109 years old. his kid is 40 years old. 
#:> Input Pattern:           re.compile('\\d+') 
#:> First Found string:      109 
#:> Found Start Position:    25 
#:> Found End Position:      28 
#:> Found Span:              (25, 28)
```

#### Find All Matches

**`findall()`** returns all matching string as **list**. If no matches found, it return an empty list.


```python
print(
  'Finding Two Digits:',
  re.findall(r'\d\d','abc123xyz456'), '\n',
  '\nFound Nothing:',
  re.findall(r'\d\d','abcxyz'))
```

```
#:> Finding Two Digits: ['12', '45'] 
#:>  
#:> Found Nothing: []
```

### Matching Condition

#### Meta Characters

```
[]     match any single character within the bracket
[1234] is the same as [1-4]
[0-39] is the same as [01239]
[a-e]  is the same as [abcde]
[^abc] means any character except a,b,c
[^0-9] means any character except 0-9
a|b:   a or b
{n,m}  at least n repetition, but maximum m repetition
()     grouping
```



```python
pattern = re.compile(r'[a-z]+')
text1 = "tempo"
text2 = "tempo1"
text3 = "123 tempo1"
text4 = " tempo"
print(
  'Matching Text1:', pattern.match(text1),
  '\nMatching Text2:', pattern.match(text2),
  '\nMatching Text3:', pattern.match(text3),
  '\nMatching Text4:', pattern.match(text4))
```

```
#:> Matching Text1: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='tempo'> 
#:> Matching Text2: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='tempo'> 
#:> Matching Text3: None 
#:> Matching Text4: None
```


#### Special Sequence

```
. : [^\n]
\d: [0-9]              \D: [^0-9]
\s: [ \t\n\r\f\v]      \S: [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
\w: [a-zA-Z0-9_]       \W: [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
\t: tab
\n: newline
\b: word boundry (delimited by space, \t, \n)
```

**Word Boundary Using `\b`**:  

- `\bABC` match if specified characters at the beginning of word (delimited by space, `\t`, `\n`), or beginning of newline  
- `ABC\b` match if specified characters at the end of word (delimited by space, `\t`, `\n`), or end of the line  


```python
text = "ABCD ABC XYZABC"
pattern1 = re.compile(r'\bABC')
pattern2 = re.compile(r'ABC\b')
pattern3 = re.compile(r'\bABC\b')

print('Match word that begins ABC:',
  pattern1.findall(text), '\n',
  'Match word that ends with ABC:',
  pattern2.findall(text),'\n',
  'Match isolated word with ABC:',
  pattern3.findall(text))
```

```
#:> Match word that begins ABC: ['ABC', 'ABC'] 
#:>  Match word that ends with ABC: ['ABC', 'ABC'] 
#:>  Match isolated word with ABC: ['ABC']
```

#### Repetition

When repetition is used, re will be **greedy**; it try to repeat as many times as possible. If **later portions of the pattern donâ€™t match**, the matching engine will then **back up and try again** with fewer repetitions.

```
?:    zero or 1 occurance
*:    zero or more occurance
+:    one  or more occurance
```

**`?` Zero or 1 Occurance**


```python
text = 'abcbcdd'
pattern = re.compile(r'a[bcd]?b')
pattern.findall(text)
```

```
#:> ['ab']
```

**`+` At Least One Occurance**


```python
text = 'abcbcdd'
pattern = re.compile(r'a[bcd]+b')
pattern.findall(text)
```

```
#:> ['abcb']
```

**`*` Zero Or More Occurance Occurance**


```python
text = 'abcbcdd'
pattern = re.compile(r'a[bcd]*b')
pattern.findall(text)
```

```
#:> ['abcb']
```

#### Greedy vs Non-Greedy

- The `*`, `+`, and `?` qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible  
- If the `<.*>` is matched against `<a> b <c>`, it will match the entire string, and not just `<a>`  
- Adding **`?`** after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>'


```python
text = '<a> ali baba <c>'
greedy_pattern     = re.compile(r'<.*>')
non_greedy_pattern = re.compile(r'<.*?>')
print( 'Greedy:      ' ,        greedy_pattern.findall(text), '\n',
       'Non Greedy: ', non_greedy_pattern.findall(text) )
```

```
#:> Greedy:       ['<a> ali baba <c>'] 
#:>  Non Greedy:  ['<a>', '<c>']
```

### Grouping

When `()` is used in the pattern, retrive the grouping components in MatchObject with `.groups()`. Result is in list. Example below extract hours, minutes and am/pm into a list.

#### Capturing Group


```python
text = 'Today at Wednesday, 10:50pm, we go for a walk'
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d\d):(\d\d)(am|pm)')
m = pattern.search(text)
print(
  'All Gropus: ', m.groups(), '\n',
  'Group 1: ', m.group(1), '\n',
  'Group 2: ', m.group(2), '\n',
  'Group 3: ', m.group(3) )
```

```
#:> All Gropus:  ('10', '50', 'pm') 
#:>  Group 1:  10 
#:>  Group 2:  50 
#:>  Group 3:  pm
```

#### Non-Capturing Group

Having `(:? )` means don't capture this group


```python
text = 'Today at Wednesday, 10:50pm, we go for a walk'
pattern = re.compile(r'(:?\d\d):(?:\d\d)(am|pm)')
m = pattern.search(text)
print(
  'All Gropus: ', m.groups(), '\n',
  'Group 1: ', m.group(1), '\n',
  'Group 2: ', m.group(2) )
```

```
#:> All Gropus:  ('10', 'pm') 
#:>  Group 1:  10 
#:>  Group 2:  pm
```

### Splittitng

Pattern is used to match **delimters**.

#### Use `re.split()`


```python
print( re.split('@',  "aa@bb @ cc "), '\n',
       re.split('\|', "aa|bb | cc "), '\n',
       re.split('\n', "sentence1\nsentence2\nsentence3") )
```

```
#:> ['aa', 'bb ', ' cc '] 
#:>  ['aa', 'bb ', ' cc '] 
#:>  ['sentence1', 'sentence2', 'sentence3']
```

#### Use `re.compile().split()`


```python
pattern = re.compile(r"\|")
pattern.split("aa|bb | cc ")
```

```
#:> ['aa', 'bb ', ' cc ']
```

### Substitution `re.sub()`


#### Found Match

Example below repalce anything within `{{.*}}`

```python
re.sub(r'({{.*}})', 'Durian', 'I like to eat {{Food}}.', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

```
#:> 'I like to eat Durian.'
```

Replace ` AND ` with ` & `. This does not require `()` grouping

```python
re.sub(r'\sAND\s', ' & ', 'Baked Beans And Spam', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

```
#:> 'Baked Beans & Spam'
```

#### No Match

If not pattern not found, return the original text.

```python
re.sub(r'({{.*}})', 'Durian', 'I like to eat <Food>.', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

```
#:> 'I like to eat <Food>.'
```
### Practical Examples

#### Extracting Float


```python
re_float = re.compile(r'\d+(\.\d+)?')
def extract_float(x):
    money = x.replace(',','')
    result = re_float.search(money)
    return float(result.group()) if result else float(0)

print( extract_float('123,456.78'), '\n',
       extract_float('rm 123.78 (30%)'), '\n',
       extract_float('rm 123,456.78 (30%)') )
```

```
#:> 123456.78 
#:>  123.78 
#:>  123456.78
```
## Word Tokenizer

### Custom Tokenizer

#### Split By Regex Pattern

Use **regex** to split words based on **specific punctuation as delimeter**.  
The rule is: split input text when any one or more continuous occurances of specified character.


```python
import re
pattern = re.compile(r"[-\s.,;!?]+")
pattern.split("hi @ali--baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:)")
```

```
#:> ['hi', '@ali', 'baba', 'you', 'are', 'aweeeeeesome', "isn't", 'it', 'Believe', 'it', ':)']
```

#### Pick By Regex Pattern `nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer`

Any sequence of chars fall within the bracket are considered tokens. Any chars not within the bracket are removed.


```python
from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer
my_tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z0-9\']+')
my_tokenizer.tokenize("hi @ali--baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:")
```

```
#:> ['hi', 'ali', 'baba', 'you', 'are', 'aweeeeeesome', "isn't", 'it', 'Believe', 'it']
```

### `nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize()`

Words and punctuations are considered as tokens!


```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

```
#:> True
#:> 
#:> [nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /home/msfz751/nltk_data...
#:> [nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!
```



```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
print( word_tokenize("hi @ali-baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:)") )
```

```
#:> ['hi', '@', 'ali-baba', ',', 'you', 'are', 'aweeeeeesome', '!', 'is', "n't", 'it', '.', 'Believe', 'it', '.', ':', ')']
```

### `nltk.tokenize.casual.casual_tokenize()`

- Support emoji
- Support reduction of repetition chars
- Support removing userid (\@someone)
- Good for social media text
- Punctuations are tokens!


```python
from nltk.tokenize.casual     import casual_tokenize
print( casual_tokenize("hi @ali-baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it. :)") )  
```

```
#:> ['hi', '@ali', '-', 'baba', ',', 'you', 'are', 'aweeeeeesome', '!', "isn't", 'it', '.', 'Believe', 'it', '.', ':)']
```

Example below shorten repeating chars, notice aweeeeeesome becomes aweeesome


```python
## shorten repeated chars
print( casual_tokenize("hi @ali-baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:)", 
          reduce_len=True))     
```

```
#:> ['hi', '@ali', '-', 'baba', ',', 'you', 'are', 'aweeesome', '!', "isn't", 'it', '.', 'Believe', 'it', '.', ':)']
```

Stripping off User ID


```python
## shorten repeated chars, stirp usernames
print( casual_tokenize("hi @ali-baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:)", 
          reduce_len=True,      
          strip_handles=True))  
```

```
#:> ['hi', '-', 'baba', ',', 'you', 'are', 'aweeesome', '!', "isn't", 'it', '.', 'Believe', 'it', '.', ':)']
```

### `nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordTokenizer().tokenize()`

Treebank assume input text is **A sentence**, hence any period combined with word is treated as token.


```python
from nltk.tokenize.treebank   import TreebankWordTokenizer
TreebankWordTokenizer().tokenize("hi @ali-baba, you are aweeeeeesome! isn't it. Believe it.:)")
```

```
#:> ['hi', '@', 'ali-baba', ',', 'you', 'are', 'aweeeeeesome', '!', 'is', "n't", 'it.', 'Believe', 'it.', ':', ')']
```

### Corpus Token Extractor

A corpus is a collection of documents (list of documents). 
A document is a text string containing one or many sentences.


```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nlpia.data.loaders import harry_docs as corpus
```


```python
## Tokenize each doc to list, then add to a bigger list
doc_tokens=[]
for doc in corpus:
  doc_tokens += [word_tokenize(doc.lower())]

print('Corpus (Contain 3 Documents):\n',corpus,'\n',
      '\nTokenized result for each document:','\n',doc_tokens)
```

```
#:> Corpus (Contain 3 Documents):
#:>  ['The faster Harry got to the store, the faster and faster Harry would get home.', 'Harry is hairy and faster than Jill.', 'Jill is not as hairy as Harry.'] 
#:>  
#:> Tokenized result for each document: 
#:>  [['the', 'faster', 'harry', 'got', 'to', 'the', 'store', ',', 'the', 'faster', 'and', 'faster', 'harry', 'would', 'get', 'home', '.'], ['harry', 'is', 'hairy', 'and', 'faster', 'than', 'jill', '.'], ['jill', 'is', 'not', 'as', 'hairy', 'as', 'harry', '.']]
```

Unpack list of token lists from above using sum. To get the **vocabulary** (unique tokens), **convert list to set**.


```python
## unpack list of list to list
vocab = sum(doc_tokens,[])
print('\nCorpus Vacabulary (Unique Tokens):\n',
       sorted(set(vocab)))
```

```
#:> 
#:> Corpus Vacabulary (Unique Tokens):
#:>  [',', '.', 'and', 'as', 'faster', 'get', 'got', 'hairy', 'harry', 'home', 'is', 'jill', 'not', 'store', 'than', 'the', 'to', 'would']
```

## Sentence Tokenizer

This is about detecting sentence boundry and split text into list of sentences

### Sample Text


```python
text = '''
Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today?
The weather is great, and city is awesome.
The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr. Alba would agree.
You shouldn't eat hard things i.e. cardboard, stones and bushes
'''
```

### 'nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktSentenceTokenizer`

- The `PunktSentenceTokenizer` is an sentence boundary detection algorithm. It is an unsupervised trainable model. This means it can be trained on unlabeled data, aka text that is not split into sentences  
- PunkSentneceTokenizer is based on work published on this paepr: [Unsupervised Multilingual Sentence Boundary Detection](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/coli.2006.32.4.485#.V2ouLXUrLeQ)

#### Default Behavior

Vanila tokenizer splits sentences on period `.`, which is not desirable


```python
from nltk.tokenize.punkt import PunktSentenceTokenizer, PunktTrainer
#nltk.download('punkt')
tokenizer = PunktSentenceTokenizer()
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text) 
for x in tokenized_text:
  print(x) 
```

```
#:> 
#:> Hello Mr.
#:> Smith, how are you doing today?
#:> The weather is great, and city is awesome.
#:> The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr.
#:> Alba would agree.
#:> You shouldn't eat hard things i.e.
#:> cardboard, stones and bushes
```

#### Pretrained Model - English Pickle

NLTK already includes a pre-trained version of the PunktSentenceTokenizer for English, as you can see, it is quite good


```python
tokenizer      = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text) 
for x in tokenized_text:
  print(x) 
```

```
#:> 
#:> Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today?
#:> The weather is great, and city is awesome.
#:> The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr. Alba would agree.
#:> You shouldn't eat hard things i.e.
#:> cardboard, stones and bushes
```

#### Adding Abbreviations

- The pretrained tokenizer is not perfect, it wrongly detected 'i.e.' as sentence boundary  
- Let's **teach** Punkt by adding the abbreviation to its parameter

**Adding Single Abbreviation**


```python

tokenizer      = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')

## Add apprevaitions to Tokenizer
tokenizer._params.abbrev_types.add('i.e')

tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text) 
for x in tokenized_text:
  print(x)
```

```
#:> 
#:> Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today?
#:> The weather is great, and city is awesome.
#:> The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr. Alba would agree.
#:> You shouldn't eat hard things i.e. cardboard, stones and bushes
```

**Add List of Abbreviations**

If you have more than one abbreviations, use `update()`  with the list of abbreviations


```python
from nltk.tokenize.punkt import PunktSentenceTokenizer, PunktParameters

## Add Abbreviations to Tokenizer
tokenizer =  nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
tokenizer._params.abbrev_types.update(['dr', 'vs', 'mr', 'mrs', 'prof', 'inc', 'i.e'])

sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(text) 
for x in sentences:
  print(x) 
```

```
#:> 
#:> Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today?
#:> The weather is great, and city is awesome.
#:> The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr. Alba would agree.
#:> You shouldn't eat hard things i.e. cardboard, stones and bushes
```

### `nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize()`

The `sent_tokenize` function uses an instance of **PunktSentenceTokenizer**, which is already been trained and thus very well knows to mark the end and begining of sentence at what characters and punctuation.
 

```python
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
for x in sentences:
  print(x) 
```

```
#:> 
#:> Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today?
#:> The weather is great, and city is awesome.
#:> The sky is pinkish-blue, Dr. Alba would agree.
#:> You shouldn't eat hard things i.e. cardboard, stones and bushes
```

## N-Gram

To create n-gram, first create 1-gram token


```python
from nltk.util import ngrams 
import re
sentence = "Thomas Jefferson began building the city, at the age of 25"
pattern = re.compile(r"[-\s.,;!?]+")
tokens = pattern.split(sentence)
print(tokens)
```

```
#:> ['Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'began', 'building', 'the', 'city', 'at', 'the', 'age', 'of', '25']
```

**ngrams()** is a generator, therefore, use **list()** to convert into full list


```python
ngrams(tokens,2)
```

```
#:> <generator object ngrams at 0x7fd5c3aee850>
```

Convert 1-gram to 2-Gram, wrap into list


```python
grammy = list( ngrams(tokens,2) )
print(grammy)
```

```
#:> [('Thomas', 'Jefferson'), ('Jefferson', 'began'), ('began', 'building'), ('building', 'the'), ('the', 'city'), ('city', 'at'), ('at', 'the'), ('the', 'age'), ('age', 'of'), ('of', '25')]
```

Combine each 2-gram into a string object


```python
[ " ".join(x) for x in grammy]
```

```
#:> ['Thomas Jefferson', 'Jefferson began', 'began building', 'building the', 'the city', 'city at', 'at the', 'the age', 'age of', 'of 25']
```

## Stopwords

### Custom Stop Words

Build the custom stop words dictionary.


```python
stop_words = ['a','an','the','on','of','off','this','is','at']
```

Tokenize text and remove stop words


```python
sentence = "The house is on fire"
tokens   = word_tokenize(sentence)
tokens_without_stopwords = [ x for x in tokens if x not in stop_words ]

print(' Original Tokens  : ', tokens, '\n',
      'Removed Stopwords: ',tokens_without_stopwords)
```

```
#:>  Original Tokens  :  ['The', 'house', 'is', 'on', 'fire'] 
#:>  Removed Stopwords:  ['The', 'house', 'fire']
```

### NLTK Stop Words

Contain 179 words, in a list form


```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

#nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk_stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
print('Total NLTK Stopwords: ', len(nltk_stop_words),'\n',
      nltk_stop_words)
```

```
#:> Total NLTK Stopwords:  179

```

### SKLearn Stop Words

Contain 318 stop words, in frozenset form


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS as sklearn_stop_words
print(' Total Sklearn Stopwords: ', len(sklearn_stop_words),'\n\n',
       sklearn_stop_words)
```

```

### Combined NLTK and SKLearn Stop Words


```python
combined_stop_words = list( set(nltk_stop_words) | set(sklearn_stop_words) )
print('Total combined NLTK and SKLearn Stopwords:', len( combined_stop_words ),'\n'
      'Stopwords shared among NLTK and SKlearn  :', len( list( set(nltk_stop_words) & set(sklearn_stop_words)) ))
```

```
#:> Total combined NLTK and SKLearn Stopwords: 378 
#:> Stopwords shared among NLTK and SKlearn  : 119
```

## Normalizing

Similar things are combined into single normalized form. This will reduced the vocabulary.

### Case Folding

If tokens aren't cap normalized, you will end up with large word list.
However, some information is often communicated by capitalization of word, such as name of places. If names are important, consider using proper noun.



```python
tokens = ['House','Visitor','Center']
[ x.lower() for x in tokens]
```

```
#:> ['house', 'visitor', 'center']
```


### Stemming

- Output of a stemmer is **not necessary a proper word**
- Automatically convert words to **lower cap**
- **Porter stemmer** is a lifetime refinement with 300 lines of python code  
- Stemming is faster then Lemmatization


```python
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
tokens = ('house','Housing','hOuses', 'Malicious','goodness')
[stemmer.stem(x) for x in tokens ]
```

```
#:> ['hous', 'hous', 'hous', 'malici', 'good']
```

### Lemmatization

NLTK uses connections within **princeton WordNet** graph for word meanings.


```python
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

```
#:> True
#:> 
#:> [nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /home/msfz751/nltk_data...
#:> [nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!
```

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

print( lemmatizer.lemmatize("better", pos ='a'), '\n',
       lemmatizer.lemmatize("better", pos ='n') )
```

```
#:> good 
#:>  better
```


```python
print( lemmatizer.lemmatize("good", pos ='a'), '\n',
       lemmatizer.lemmatize("good", pos ='n') )
```

```
#:> good 
#:>  good
```

### Comparing Stemming and Lemmatization

- Lemmatization is slower than stemming
= Lemmatization is better at retaining meanings
- Lemmatization produce valid english word
- Stemming not necessary produce valid english word
- Both reduce vocabulary size, but increase ambiguity
- For search engine application, stemming and lemmatization will improve recall as it associate more documents with the same query words, however with the cost of reducing precision and accuracy.

For search-based chatbot where accuracy is more important, it should first search with unnormalzied words.



## Wordnet

WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.  

WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions:  
- WordNet interlinks not just word formsâ€”strings of lettersâ€”but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated  
- WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity

### NLTK and Wordnet

NLTK (version 3.7.6) includes the English WordNet (147,307 words and 117,659 synonym sets)


```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

s = set( wn.all_synsets() )
w = set(wn.words())
print('Total words in wordnet  : ' ,   len(w),
      '\nTotal synsets in wordnet: ' , len(s) )
```

```
#:> Total words in wordnet  :  147306 
#:> Total synsets in wordnet:  117659
```

### Synset

#### Notation

A synset is the basic construct of a word in wordnet. It contains the **Word** itself, with its **POS** tag and **Usage**: **`word.pos.nn`**


```python
wn.synset('breakdown.n.03')
```

```
#:> Synset('breakdown.n.03')
```

Breaking down the construct:

```
'breakdown' = Word
'n'         = Part of Speech
'03'        = Usage (01 for most common usage and a higher number would indicate lesser common usages)
```

#### Part of Speech

Wordnet support five POS tags

```
n - NOUN
v - VERB
a - ADJECTIVE
s - ADJECTIVE SATELLITE
r - ADVERB
```


```python
print(wn.ADJ, wn.ADJ_SAT, wn.ADV, wn.NOUN, wn.VERB)
```

```
#:> a s r n v
```

#### Synset Similarity

Let's see how similar are the below two nouns


```python
w1 = wn.synset('dog.n.01')
w2 = wn.synset('ship.n.01')
print(w1.wup_similarity(w2))
```

```
#:> 0.4
```


```python
w1 = wn.synset('ship.n.01')
w2 = wn.synset('boat.n.01')
print(w1.wup_similarity(w2))
```

```
#:> 0.9090909090909091
```


### Synsets

- Synsets is a collection of synsets, which are synonyms that share a common meaning  
- A synset (member of Synsets) is identified with a 3-part name of the form: 
- A synset can contain one or more lemmas, which represent a specific sense of a specific word  
- A synset can contain one or more **Hyponyms and Hypernyms**. These are specific and generalized concepts respectively. For example, 'beach house' and 'guest house' are hyponyms of 'house'. They are more specific concepts of 'house'. And 'house' is a hypernym of 'guest house' because it is the general concept  
-  **Hyponyms and Hypernyms** are also called lexical relations


```python
dogs = wn.synsets('dog') # get all synsets for word 'dog'

for d in dogs:  ## iterate through each Synset
  print(d,':\nDefinition:', d.definition(),
           '\nExample:',    d.examples(),
           '\nLemmas:',     d.lemma_names(),
           '\nHyponyms:',   d.hyponyms(), 
           '\nHypernyms:',  d.hypernyms(), '\n\n')

## Part Of Speech (POS)

- In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called **grammatical tagging** or **word-category disambiguation**, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph  
- This is useful for Information Retrieval, Text to Speech, Word Sense Disambiguation  
- The primary target of Part-of-Speech(POS) tagging is to identify the grammatical group of a given word. Whether it is a NOUN, PRONOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, ADVERBS, etc. based on the context  
- A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc  

### Tag Sets

- Schools commonly teach that there are 9 parts of speech in English: noun, verb, article, adjective, preposition, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, and interjection  
- However, there are clearly many more categories and sub-categories 


```python
 nltk.download('universal_tagset')
```

#### Universal Tagset

This tagset contains **12** coarse tags

```
VERB - verbs (all tenses and modes)
NOUN - nouns (common and proper)
PRON - pronouns
ADJ - adjectives
ADV - adverbs
ADP - adpositions (prepositions and postpositions)
CONJ - conjunctions
DET - determiners
NUM - cardinal numbers
PRT - particles or other function words
X - other: foreign words, typos, abbreviations
. - punctuation
```

#### Penn Treebank Tagset

- This is the most popular "tag set" for American English, developed in the Penn Treebank project  
- It has **36 POS tags plus 12** others for punctuations and special symbols

### Tagging Techniques

There are few types of tagging techniques:  

- Lexical-based  
- Rule-based  (Brill)
- Probalistic/Stochastic-based  (Conditional Random Fields-CRFs, Hidden Markov Models-HMM)
- Neural network-based  

NLTK supports the below taggers: 
```
from nltk.tag.brill      import BrillTagger
from nltk.tag.hunpos     import HunposTagger
from nltk.tag.stanford   import StanfordTagger, StanfordPOSTagger, StanfordNERTagger
from nltk.tag.hmm        import HiddenMarkovModelTagger, HiddenMarkovModelTrainer
from nltk.tag.senna      import SennaTagger, SennaChunkTagger, SennaNERTagger
from nltk.tag.crf        import CRFTagger
from nltk.tag.perceptron import PerceptronTagger
```

#### nltk `PerceptronTagger` 

PerceptronTagger produce tags with **Penn Treebank** tagset


```python
from nltk.tag import PerceptronTagger

nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

```
#:> True
#:> 
#:> [nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to
#:> [nltk_data]     /home/msfz751/nltk_data...
#:> [nltk_data]   Package averaged_perceptron_tagger is already up-to-
#:> [nltk_data]       date!
```

```python
tagger = PerceptronTagger()
print('Tagger Classes:', tagger.classes, 
      '\n\n# Classes:', len(tagger.classes))
```

```
#:> Tagger Classes: {'RP', "''", 'JJ', 'PRP$', 'NNPS', 'FW', '#', 'NN', 'TO', 'IN', 'VBZ', 'WRB', '$', 'WDT', 'WP', ')', 'POS', ',', 'JJS', 'RBS', 'NNS', 'LS', 'NNP', 'VBP', 'VBN', 'VBD', 'VBG', 'CD', '``', 'MD', 'WP$', 'PRP', 'PDT', 'EX', '.', 'VB', 'DT', 'UH', 'CC', 'RBR', 'SYM', 'JJR', ':', '(', 'RB'} 
#:> 
#:> # Classes: 45
```

### Performing Tagging `nltk.pos_tag()`

Tagging works sentence by sentence:  

- Document fist must be splitted into sentences  
- Each sentence need to be tokenized into words  
- Default NTLK uses `PerceptronTagger`


```python
#nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
#import nltk
#from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize 
doc = '''Sukanya, Rajib and Naba are my good friends. Sukanya is getting married next year. Marriage is a big step in one's life. It is both exciting and frightening. But friendship is a sacred bond between people. It is a special kind of love between us. Many of you must have tried searching for a friend but never found the right one.'''

sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(doc)
for sentence in sentences:
  tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
  tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
  print(tagged)
```

```
#:> [('Sukanya', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ('Rajib', 'NNP'), ('and', 'CC'), ('Naba', 'NNP'), ('are', 'VBP'), ('my', 'PRP$'), ('good', 'JJ'), ('friends', 'NNS'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('Sukanya', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('getting', 'VBG'), ('married', 'VBN'), ('next', 'JJ'), ('year', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('Marriage', 'NN'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('big', 'JJ'), ('step', 'NN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('one', 'CD'), ("'s", 'POS'), ('life', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('It', 'PRP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('both', 'DT'), ('exciting', 'VBG'), ('and', 'CC'), ('frightening', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('But', 'CC'), ('friendship', 'NN'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('sacred', 'JJ'), ('bond', 'NN'), ('between', 'IN'), ('people', 'NNS'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('It', 'PRP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('special', 'JJ'), ('kind', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('love', 'NN'), ('between', 'IN'), ('us', 'PRP'), ('.', '.')]
#:> [('Many', 'JJ'), ('of', 'IN'), ('you', 'PRP'), ('must', 'MD'), ('have', 'VB'), ('tried', 'VBN'), ('searching', 'VBG'), ('for', 'IN'), ('a', 'DT'), ('friend', 'NN'), ('but', 'CC'), ('never', 'RB'), ('found', 'VBD'), ('the', 'DT'), ('right', 'JJ'), ('one', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
```

## Sentiment

### NLTK and Senti-Wordnet

- SentiWordNet **extends Wordnet Synsets** with positive and negative sentiment scores  
- The extension was achieved via a complex mix of propagation methods and classifiers. It is thus not a gold standard resource like WordNet (which was compiled by humans), but it has proven useful in a wide range of tasks  
- It contains similar number of synsets as wordnet


```python
from nltk.corpus import sentiwordnet as swn
nltk.download('sentiwordnet')
```

```
#:> True
#:> 
#:> [nltk_data] Downloading package sentiwordnet to
#:> [nltk_data]     /home/msfz751/nltk_data...
#:> [nltk_data]   Package sentiwordnet is already up-to-date!
```

```python
s = set( swn.all_senti_synsets() )
print('Total synsets in senti-wordnet  : ' ,   len(s))
```

```
#:> Total synsets in senti-wordnet  :  117659
```

#### Senti-Synset

- Senti-Wordnet extends wordnet with three(3) sentiment scores: positive, negative, objective  
- All three scores added up to value 1.0


```python
breakdown = swn.senti_synset('breakdown.n.03')
print(
  breakdown, '\n'
  'Positive:', breakdown.pos_score(), '\n',
  'Negative:', breakdown.neg_score(), '\n',
  'Objective:',breakdown.obj_score()
)
```

```
#:> <breakdown.n.03: PosScore=0.0 NegScore=0.25> 
#:> Positive: 0.0 
#:>  Negative: 0.25 
#:>  Objective: 0.75
```

#### Senti-Synsets

Get all the synonmys, with and without the POS information


```python
print( list(swn.senti_synsets('slow')), '\n\n',  ## without POS tag
       list(swn.senti_synsets('slow', 'a')) )   ## with POS tag
```

```
#:> [SentiSynset('decelerate.v.01'), SentiSynset('slow.v.02'), SentiSynset('slow.v.03'), SentiSynset('slow.a.01'), SentiSynset('slow.a.02'), SentiSynset('dense.s.04'), SentiSynset('slow.a.04'), SentiSynset('boring.s.01'), SentiSynset('dull.s.08'), SentiSynset('slowly.r.01'), SentiSynset('behind.r.03')] 
#:> 
#:>  [SentiSynset('slow.a.01'), SentiSynset('slow.a.02'), SentiSynset('dense.s.04'), SentiSynset('slow.a.04'), SentiSynset('boring.s.01'), SentiSynset('dull.s.08')]
```

Get the score for first synset


```python
first_synset = list(swn.senti_synsets('slow','a'))[0]

print(
  first_synset, '\n',
  'Positive:',  first_synset.pos_score(), '\n',
  'Negative:',  first_synset.neg_score(), '\n',
  'Objective:', first_synset.obj_score()
)
```

```
#:> <slow.a.01: PosScore=0.0 NegScore=0.0> 
#:>  Positive: 0.0 
#:>  Negative: 0.0 
#:>  Objective: 1.0
```

#### Converting POS-tag into Wordnet POS-tag

**Using Function**


```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

def penn_to_wn(tag):
    """
    Convert between the PennTreebank tags to simple Wordnet tags
    """
    if tag.startswith('J'):
        return wn.ADJ
    elif tag.startswith('N'):
        return wn.NOUN
    elif tag.startswith('R'):
        return wn.ADV
    elif tag.startswith('V'):
        return wn.VERB
    return None

wt = word_tokenize("Star Wars is a wonderful movie")
penn_tags = nltk.pos_tag(wt)
wordnet_tags = [ (x, penn_to_wn(y)) for (x,y) in penn_tags ]

print(
'Penn Tags    :', penn_tags, 
'\nWordnet Tags :', wordnet_tags)
```

```
#:> Penn Tags    : [('Star', 'NNP'), ('Wars', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('wonderful', 'JJ'), ('movie', 'NN')] 
#:> Wordnet Tags : [('Star', 'n'), ('Wars', 'n'), ('is', 'v'), ('a', None), ('wonderful', 'a'), ('movie', 'n')]
```

**Using defaultdict**


```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn
from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag
from collections import defaultdict

tag_map = defaultdict(lambda : None)
tag_map['J'] = wn.ADJ
tag_map['R'] = wn.ADV
tag_map['V'] = wn.VERB
tag_map['N'] = wn.NOUN

wt = word_tokenize("Star Wars is a wonderful movie")
penn_tags = nltk.pos_tag(wt)
wordnet_tags = [ (x, tag_map[y[0]]) for (x,y) in penn_tags ]

print(
'Penn Tags    :', penn_tags, 
'\nWordnet Tags :', wordnet_tags)
```

```
#:> Penn Tags    : [('Star', 'NNP'), ('Wars', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('wonderful', 'JJ'), ('movie', 'NN')] 
#:> Wordnet Tags : [('Star', 'n'), ('Wars', 'n'), ('is', 'v'), ('a', None), ('wonderful', 'a'), ('movie', 'n')]
```

### Vader

- It is a rule based sentiment analyzer, contain 7503 lexicons
- It is good for **social media** because lexicon contain **emoji and short** form text
- Contain only **3 n-gram**
- Supported by NTLK or install vader seperately (pip install vaderSentiment)  

#### Vader Lexicon

The lexicon is a dictionary. To make it iterable, need to convert into list:  
- Step 1: Convert `dict` to `dict_items`, which is a list containing items, each item is one dict  
- Step 2: Unpack `dict_items` to `list`


```python
#from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer   ## seperate pip installed library
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

```
#:> True
#:> 
#:> [nltk_data] Downloading package vader_lexicon to
#:> [nltk_data]     /home/msfz751/nltk_data...
#:> [nltk_data]   Package vader_lexicon is already up-to-date!
```

```python
vader_lex  = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer().lexicon  # get the lexicon dictionary
vader_list = list(vader_lex.items())               # convert to items then list
print( 'Total Vader Lexicon:', len(vader_lex),'\n',
        vader_list[1:10], vader_list[220:240] )
```

```
#:> Total Vader Lexicon: 7502 
#:>  [('%)', -0.4), ('%-)', -1.5), ('&-:', -0.4), ('&:', -0.7), ("( '}{' )", 1.6), ('(%', -0.9), ("('-:", 2.2), ("(':", 2.3), ('((-:', 2.1)] [('b^d', 2.6), ('cwot', -2.3), ("d-':", -2.5), ('d8', -3.2), ('d:', 1.2), ('d:<', -3.2), ('d;', -2.9), ('d=', 1.5), ('doa', -2.3), ('dx', -3.0), ('ez', 1.5), ('fav', 2.0), ('fcol', -1.8), ('ff', 1.8), ('ffs', -2.8), ('fkm', -2.4), ('foaf', 1.8), ('ftw', 2.0), ('fu', -3.7), ('fubar', -3.0)]
```

**There is only four N-Gram in the lexicon**


```python
print('List of N-grams: ')
```

```
#:> List of N-grams:
```

```python
[ (tok,score) for tok, score in vader_list if " " in tok]
```

```
#:> [("( '}{' )", 1.6), ("can't stand", -2.0), ('fed up', -1.8), ('screwed up', -1.5)]
```

If stemming or lemmatization is used, stem/lemmatize the vader lexicon too


```python
[ (tok,score) for tok, score in vader_list if "lov" in tok]
```

```
#:> [('beloved', 2.3), ('lovable', 3.0), ('love', 3.2), ('loved', 2.9), ('lovelies', 2.2), ('lovely', 2.8), ('lover', 2.8), ('loverly', 2.8), ('lovers', 2.4), ('loves', 2.7), ('loving', 2.9), ('lovingly', 3.2), ('lovingness', 2.7), ('unlovable', -2.7), ('unloved', -1.9), ('unlovelier', -1.9), ('unloveliest', -1.9), ('unloveliness', -2.0), ('unlovely', -2.1), ('unloving', -2.3)]
```

#### Polarity Scoring

Scoring result is a dictionary of:

- neg
- neu
- pos
- compound
**neg, neu, pos adds up to 1.0**

Example below shows polarity for two sentences:


```python
corpus = ["Python is a very useful but hell difficult to learn",
        ":) :) :("]
for doc in corpus:
  print(doc, '-->', "\n:", SentimentIntensityAnalyzer().polarity_scores(doc) )
```

```
#:> Python is a very useful but hell difficult to learn --> 
#:> : {'neg': 0.554, 'neu': 0.331, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': -0.8735}
#:> :) :) :( --> 
#:> : {'neg': 0.326, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.674, 'compound': 0.4767}
```

## Feature Representation

### The Data

A corpus is a collection of multiple documents. In the below example, each document is represented by a sentence.


```python
corpus = [
   'This is the first document, :)',
   'This document is the second document.',
   'And this is a third one',
   'Is this the first document?',
]
```

### Frequency Count

Using purely frequency count as a feature will obviously bias on long document (which contain a lot of words, hence words within the document will have very high frequency).

#### + Tokenizer

**Default Tokenizer**  
By default, vectorizer apply tokenizer to select minimum **2-chars alphanumeric words**.  Below **train** the vectorizer using **`fit_transform()`**.


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vec = CountVectorizer()          # initialize the vectorizer
X   = vec.fit_transform(corpus)  # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data
print(pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vec.get_feature_names()),'\n\n',
      'Vocabulary: ', vec.vocabulary_)
```

```
#:>    and  document  first  is  one  second  the  third  this
#:> 0    0         1      1   1    0       0    1      0     1
#:> 1    0         2      0   1    0       1    1      0     1
#:> 2    1         0      0   1    1       0    0      1     1
#:> 3    0         1      1   1    0       0    1      0     1 
#:> 
#:>  Vocabulary:  {'this': 8, 'is': 3, 'the': 6, 'first': 2, 'document': 1, 'second': 5, 'and': 0, 'third': 7, 'one': 4}
```

**Custom Tokenizer**  
You can use a custom tokenizer, which is a **function that return list of words**. Example below uses nltk RegexpTokenizer function, which retains one or more alphanumeric characters.


```python
my_tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z0-9\']+')  ## Custom Tokenizer
vec2 = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=my_tokenizer.tokenize) ## custom tokenizer's function
X2   = vec2.fit_transform(corpus)  # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data
print(pd.DataFrame(X2.toarray(), columns=vec2.get_feature_names()),'\n\n',
      'Vocabulary: ', vec.vocabulary_)
```

```
#:>    a  and  document  first  is  one  second  the  third  this
#:> 0  0    0         1      1   1    0       0    1      0     1
#:> 1  0    0         2      0   1    0       1    1      0     1
#:> 2  1    1         0      0   1    1       0    0      1     1
#:> 3  0    0         1      1   1    0       0    1      0     1 
#:> 
#:>  Vocabulary:  {'this': 8, 'is': 3, 'the': 6, 'first': 2, 'document': 1, 'second': 5, 'and': 0, 'third': 7, 'one': 4}
```

**1 and 2-Word-Gram Tokenizer**  
Use `ngram_range()` to specify range of grams needed.


```python
vec3 = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))          # initialize the vectorizer
X3   = vec3.fit_transform(corpus)     # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data
print(pd.DataFrame(X3.toarray(), columns=vec3.get_feature_names()),'\n\n',
      'Vocabulary: ', vec.vocabulary_)
```

```
#:>    and  and this  document  document is  first  ...  third one  this  this document  \
#:> 0    0         0         1            0      1  ...          0     1              0   
#:> 1    0         0         2            1      0  ...          0     1              1   
#:> 2    1         1         0            0      0  ...          1     1              0   
#:> 3    0         0         1            0      1  ...          0     1              0   
#:> 
#:>    this is  this the  
#:> 0        1         0  
#:> 1        0         0  
#:> 2        1         0  
#:> 3        0         1  
#:> 
#:> [4 rows x 22 columns] 
#:> 
#:>  Vocabulary:  {'this': 8, 'is': 3, 'the': 6, 'first': 2, 'document': 1, 'second': 5, 'and': 0, 'third': 7, 'one': 4}
```

**Apply Trained Vectorizer**
Once the vectorizer had been trained, you can apply them on new corpus. **Tokens not in the vectorizer vocubulary are ignored**.


```python
new_corpus = ["My Name is Charlie Angel", "I love to watch Star Wars"]
XX = vec.transform(new_corpus)
pd.DataFrame(XX.toarray(), columns=vec.get_feature_names())
```

```
#:>    and  document  first  is  one  second  the  third  this
#:> 0    0         0      0   1    0       0    0      0     0
#:> 1    0         0      0   0    0       0    0      0     0
```

#### + Stop Words

Vectorizer can optionally be use with stop words list. Use `stop_words=english` to apply filtering using sklearn built-in stop word.  You can replace `english` with other word **list object**.


```python
vec4 = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english') ## sklearn stopwords list
X4 = vec4.fit_transform(corpus)
pd.DataFrame(X4.toarray(), columns=vec4.get_feature_names())
```

```
#:>    document  second
#:> 0         1       0
#:> 1         2       1
#:> 2         0       0
#:> 3         1       0
```

### TFIDF

#### Equation

$$tf(t,d) = \text{occurances of term t in document t} \\
n     = \text{number of documents} \\
df(t) = \text{number of documents containing term t} \\
idf(t)  = log \frac{n}{df(t))} + 1 \\
idf(t)  = log \frac{1+n}{1+df(t))} + 1 \text{.... smoothing, prevent zero division} \\
tfidf(t) = tf(t) * idf(t,d)    \text{.... raw, no normalization on tf(t)} \\
tfidf(t) = \frac{tf(t,d)}{||V||_2} * idf(t)    \text{.... tf normalized with euclidean norm}$$

#### `TfidfTransformer`

To generate TFIDF vectors, first run `CountVectorizer` to get frequency vector matrix. Then take the output into this transformer.


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer

corpus = [
    "apple apple apple apple apple banana",
    "apple apple",
    "apple apple apple banana",
    "durian durian durian"]
    
count_vec = CountVectorizer()
X = count_vec.fit_transform(corpus)

transformer1 = TfidfTransformer(smooth_idf=False,norm=None)
transformer2 = TfidfTransformer(smooth_idf=False,norm='l2')
transformer3 = TfidfTransformer(smooth_idf=True,norm='l2')

tfidf1 = transformer1.fit_transform(X)
tfidf2 = transformer2.fit_transform(X)
tfidf3 = transformer3.fit_transform(X)

print(
  'Frequency Count: \n', pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=count_vec.get_feature_names()),
  '\n\nVocabulary: ', count_vec.vocabulary_,
  '\n\nTFIDF Without Norm:\n',tfidf1.toarray(), 
  '\n\nTFIDF with L2 Norm:\n',tfidf2.toarray(),  
  '\n\nTFIDF with L2 Norm (smooth):\n',tfidf3.toarray())
```

```

```

#### `TfidfVectorizer`

This vectorizer gives end to end processing from corpus into TFIDF vector matrix, including tokenization, stopwords.


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
my_tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z0-9\']+')  ## Custom Tokenizer

vec1 = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=my_tokenizer.tokenize,  stop_words='english') #default smooth_idf=True, norm='l2'
vec2 = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=my_tokenizer.tokenize, stop_words='english',smooth_idf=False)
vec3 = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=my_tokenizer.tokenize, stop_words='english', norm=None)

X1   = vec1.fit_transform(corpus)  # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data
X2   = vec2.fit_transform(corpus)  # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data
X3   = vec3.fit_transform(corpus)  # FIT the vectorizer, return fitted data

print(
  'TFIDF Features (Default with Smooth and L2 Norm):\n',
  pd.DataFrame(X1.toarray().round(3), columns=vec1.get_feature_names()),
  '\n\nTFIDF Features (without Smoothing):\n',
  pd.DataFrame(X2.toarray().round(3), columns=vec2.get_feature_names()),
  '\n\nTFIDF Features (without L2 Norm):\n',
  pd.DataFrame(X3.toarray().round(3), columns=vec3.get_feature_names())
  )
```

```

## Appliction

### Document Similarity

Document1 and Document 2 are mutiplicate of Document0, therefore their consine similarity is the same.


```python
documents = (
    "apple apple banana",
    "apple apple banana apple apple banana",
    "apple apple banana apple apple banana apple apple banana")
    
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
tfidf_vec = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vec.fit_transform(documents)

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
print('Cosine Similarity betwen doc0 and doc1:\n',cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[1]))
```

```
#:> Cosine Similarity betwen doc0 and doc1:
#:>  [[1.]]
```

```python
print('Cosine Similarity betwen doc1 and doc2:\n',cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[1], tfidf_matrix[2]))
```

```
#:> Cosine Similarity betwen doc1 and doc2:
#:>  [[1.]]
```

```python
print('Cosine Similarity betwen doc1 and doc2:\n',cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[2]))
```

```
#:> Cosine Similarity betwen doc1 and doc2:
#:>  [[1.]]
```

### Bag of Words

- Tokenize each record, remove single character token, then convert into list of counters (words-frequency pair).  
- Each item in the list is a counter, which represent word frequency within the record


```python
bag_of_words = []
for text in movies.text:
    tokens = casual_tokenize(text, reduce_len=True, strip_handles=True)  # tokenize
    tokens = [x for x in tokens if len(x)>1]                  ## remove single char token
    bag_of_words.append( Counter(tokens, strip_handles=True)  ## add to our BoW
    )

unique_words =  list( set([ y  for x in bag_of_words  for y in x.keys()]) )

print("Total Rows: ", len(bag_of_words),'\n\n',
      'Row 1 BoW: ',bag_of_words[:1],'\n\n',    # see the first two records
      'Row 2 BoW: ', bag_of_words[:2], '\n\n',
      'Total Unique Words: ', len(unique_words))
```

```

**Convert NaN into 0 then all features into integer**


```python
bows_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(bag_of_words)
bows_df = bows_df.fillna(0).astype(int)  # replace NaN with 0, change to integer
bows_df.head()
```

```

### Build The Model


```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
train_y  = movies.sentiment>0   # label
train_X  = bows_df              # features
nb_model = MultinomialNB().fit( train_X, train_y)
```

### Train Set Prediction

First, make a prediction on training data, then compare to ground truth. 


```python
train_predicted = nb_model.predict(bows_df)
print("Accuracy: ", np.mean(train_predicted==train_y).round(4))
```

```
#:> Accuracy:  0.9357
```
